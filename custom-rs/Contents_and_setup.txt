Contents and setup - custom-rs/

Place the directory custom-rs/* in the buildroot-20xx.yy directory

Create symlink in buildroot-20xx.yy that points to buildroot-rs-config
	cd /path/to/buildroot-20xx.yy/
	ln custom-rs/buildroot-rs-config .config
	# or just copy it instead of symlinking... though symlinking allows
	#     altering your config and keeping the custom-rs/ copy up to date
